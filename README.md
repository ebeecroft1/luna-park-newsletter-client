# Mini collaboration between UX & SE

This project was the result of a two-day collaboration with General Assembly UX design student. Our brief was to create a new form for users to sign up for the latest newsletter from our example client, Luna Park. We elected to work with a Vue/Node stack since we were most familiar with Node backends and wanted to stretch ourselves by learning Vue. During the two days, we were also able to deliver a back office site where administrators could view users who have signed up for the newsletter. </br>
